# Walmart Sales Data Analysis
# Overview
This project explores Walmartâ€™s sales data to identify key trends in revenue, product performance, and customer purchasing behavior. Using Excel for data cleaning, pivot analysis, and visualization, I developed an interactive dashboard that highlights top-performing branches, best-selling products, and sales patterns across weekdays and holidays. The analysis provides insights to support inventory planning and business growth decisions.
